## Reviewing ##

I have served as a (sub-) reviewer for various journals including TNNLS, AIJ, MLJ, CI, and conferences including IJCAI, ILP, and others.

## Advising ##

I serve as a faculty adviser for the Czech *Upsilon Pi Epsilon* (UPE) honor society for talented CS students.
I coordinate the local chapter activities, report to the US central, secure funding, etc. We won the outstanding UPE chapter [award](http://cs.fel.cvut.cz/en/news/detail/1068).

# Supervising #

I have supervised the following Bachelor's and Master's students:
