I'm a PhD student and researcher in the [Intelligent Data Analysis](http://ida.fel.cvut.cz) lab at the Department of Computer Science at Czech Technical University in Prague. I'm generally interested in Artificial Intelligence technologies, with a particular focus on (deep) relational machine learning - i.e. learning from data with complex dependencies and structures such as (knowledge) graphs and databases.

I received my B.Sc. in "Intelligent Systems" and M.Sc. in "Artificial Intelligence" at Czech Technical University. Currently, I'm pursuing PhD at the same alma mater, where I've been also serving as a tutor in several courses.
In the meantime, I've also gained some international experience from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, National Taiwanese University of Science and Technology, Taipei, and University of York. I also got my hands dirty with some research projects at IBM Research in Haifa, and Google in Zurich.
