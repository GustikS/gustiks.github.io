I'm a PhD student and researcher in the [Intelligent Data Analysis](http://ida.fel.cvut.cz) lab at the [Department of Computer Science](http://cs.fel.cvut.cz/) of the [Faculty of Electrical Engineering](fel.cvut.cz/en) at [Czech Technical University](https://cvut.cz/en/) in Prague, Czech Republic.

I'm interested in Artificial Intelligence technologies, with a particular focus on (deep) relational machine learning - i.e. learning from data with complex dependencies and structures such as (knowledge) graphs and databases. To approach these problems, I like to combine formal representations from relational logic with representation learning ideas from deep learning.

I received my B.Sc. in *Intelligent Systems* and M.Sc. in *Artificial Intelligence* at Czech Technical University. Currently, I'm pursuing PhD in *Artificial Intelligence* at the same alma mater, where I've been also serving as a tutor in several courses.

In the meantime, I've also gained some international experience from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, National Taiwanese University of Science and Technology, Taipei, and University of York. I also got my hands dirty with some research projects at IBM Research in Haifa, and Google in Zurich.
