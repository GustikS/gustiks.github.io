I'm a PhD student and researcher in the [Intelligent Data Analysis](http://ida.fel.cvut.cz) lab at the [Department of Computer Science](http://cs.fel.cvut.cz/) of the [Faculty of Electrical Engineering](https://www.fel.cvut.cz/en) at [Czech Technical University](https://www.cvut.cz/en) in Prague, Czech Republic.

I'm interested in Artificial Intelligence research, with a particular focus on (deep) *relational* machine learning - i.e. learning from data with complex dependencies and structures such as (knowledge) graphs and databases. To approach this problem, I like to combine formal representations from relational logic with ideas from deep learning. You can find all the details in my [**dissertation thesis**](/publications/dissertation.md).

I received my B.Sc. in *Intelligent Systems* and M.Sc. in *Artificial Intelligence* from Czech Technical University. Currently, I'm pursuing Ph.D. in *Artificial Intelligence* at the same alma mater, where I've been also serving as a tutor in several [courses](teaching.md). I also server as a faculty adviser of the local [Upsilon Pi Epsilon](http://upe.cvut.cz/) honor society for talented computer science students.

During the studies, I've also gained some international experience from [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) in Singapore, [National Taiwanese University of Science and Technology](https://www.ntust.edu.tw/?Lang=en), Taipei, and [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/). I also got my hands dirty with some work at companies such as Citibank or IBM, as well as some research projects at [IBM Research](https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/haifa/) in Haifa and [Google](https://research.google/locations/zurich/) in Zurich.

I'm profoundly interested in the impacts of AI on humanity. I support local Unicef and People-in-Need  branches. I spend most of my spare time with my wife and kids, but I also love traveling, diving and paragliding.
