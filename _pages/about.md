I'm an assistant professor in the [Intelligent Data Analysis](http://ida.fel.cvut.cz) lab at the [Department of Computer Science](http://cs.fel.cvut.cz/) of the [Faculty of Electrical Engineering](https://www.fel.cvut.cz/en) at [Czech Technical University](https://www.cvut.cz/en) in Prague, Czech Republic.

I'm interested in Artificial Intelligence research, with a particular focus on (deep) *relational* machine learning - i.e. learning from data with complex dependencies and structures such as (knowledge) graphs and databases. 
To approach this problem, I like to combine formal representations from *relational logic* with ideas from *deep learning*. 
You can find all the details in my [**dissertation thesis**](/publication/dissertation), which was also published as a [book](https://www.iospress.com/catalog/books/deep-learning-with-relational-logic-representations). 
I have also created a corresponding learning framework called [Lifted Relational Neural Networks](/portfolio/lrnns).
Additionally, I'm also interested in predictive sports analytics [trading](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207022000292).

I received my B.Sc. in *Intelligent Systems*, M.Sc. in *Artificial Intelligence*, and Ph.D. in *Artificial Intelligence & BioCybernetics* from Czech Technical University. 
Since then I've been teaching in several [courses](teaching.md), and I also serve as a faculty adviser of the local [Upsilon Pi Epsilon](http://upe.cvut.cz/) honor society for talented computer science students.

During the studies, I've also gained some international experience from [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) in Singapore, [National Taiwanese University of Science and Technology](https://www.ntust.edu.tw/?Lang=en) in Taipei, and [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/). 
I also got my hands dirty with some work at companies such as Citibank or IBM, as well as some research projects at [IBM Research](https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/haifa/) in Haifa and [Google](https://research.google/locations/zurich/) in Zurich.

I'm profoundly interested in the [impacts of AI](https://medium.com/@sir.gustav/five-human-dangers-of-artificial-intelligence-ccf2ae4b92c7) on humanity. I support local Unicef and People-in-Need  branches. I spend most of my spare time with my wife and kids, but I also love traveling, diving and paragliding.
