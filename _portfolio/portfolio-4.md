The project covers research topics targeted in the group of Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA) from the Department of Computer Science. The project topic reflects the focus of the group itself, which consists of 2 main components, (i) machine learning and (ii) bioinformatics. This encompasses all research stages spanning from formal analysis of algorithms, design of learning models, and their applications in various, mainly relational, domains. The common underlying factor is in innovative approach to problem solving, enabling for the research to be published in academic venues, which is also the main goal of the project.
