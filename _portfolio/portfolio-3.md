To perform sophisticated traffic analysis, such as intrusion detection, network monitoring tools firstly need to extract higher-level information from lower-level data by reconstructing events and activities from as primitive information as individual network packets or traffic flows. Aggregating communication data into meaningful entities is an open problem and existing, typically clustering-based, solutions are often highly suboptimal, producing results that may misinterpret the extracted information and consequently miss many network events. We propose a novel method for the extraction of various predefined types of network events from raw network flow data. The new method is based on analysis of computational properties of the event types as prescribed by their attributes in a given descriptive language. The corresponding events are then extracted with a supreme recall as compared to a respective event extraction part of an in-production intrusion detection system Camnep.

A method resulting from this project was later [patented](/publications/patent) by Cisco.
