[NeuraLogic](https://github.com/GustikS/NeuraLogic) - a custom framework for deep *relational* learning, written completely from scratch in Java (with a Python frontend in progress).
It allows for combining relational and deep learning through a form of differentiable logic programming. It is an official implementation of the [Lifted Relational Neural Networks](/publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1) concept.
