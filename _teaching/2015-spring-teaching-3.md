This course introduces students into the techniques of functional programming in the LISP (or more precisely SCHEME) and HASKELL language and logic programming in the PROLOG language. Both languages are declarative in that the programmer symbolically describes the problem to be solved, rather than enumerating the exact sequence of actions to be taken. In PROLOG, one describes the problem by specifying properties of objects and relations thereamong through logic formulas. In LISP, the problem description takes the form of function definitions. Both languages have found significant applications in artificial intelligence fields, such as agent systems or symbolic machine learning. Motivating tasks from these domains will be used throughout the course.
