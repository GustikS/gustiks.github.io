In one embodiment, a system includes a processor to receive network flows, for each of one of a plurality of event-types, compare each one of the network flows to a flow-specific criteria of the one event-type to determine if the one network flow satisfies the flow-specific criteria, for each one of the event-types, for each one of the network flows satisfying the flow-specific criteria of the one event-type, assign the one network flow to a proto-event of the one-event type, test different combinations of the network flows assigned to the proto-event of the one event-type against aggregation criteria of the one event-type to determine if one combination of the network flows assigned to the proto-event of the one event-type satisfies the aggregation criteria for the one event-type and identifies an event of the one event-type from among the network flows of the proto-event. Related apparatus and methods are also described.
